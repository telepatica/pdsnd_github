### Udacity Bikeshare_Project

### Description
This project makes use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and
Washington. The project takes raw input to give descirptive statistics on
bikeshare data in three major cities.

### Files used and software needed
Python 3, NumPy, pandas plus bikeshare data from Chicago, Washington
and New York.

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

### Credits
Thanks to the udacity mentors for helping me to debug while I learn to work
out of a local environment.
